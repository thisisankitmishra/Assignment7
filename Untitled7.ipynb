        "Question 1: What is the difference between AI, ML, DL, and Data Science? Provide a brief explanation of each.\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the field of building systems that can mimic human intelligence, reasoning, and decision making. Applications include chatbots, robotics, and autonomous vehicles.\n",
        "\n",
        "Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that focuses on algorithms that learn from data to make predictions. Techniques include regression, classification, clustering. Examples: spam detection, recommendations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Deep Learning (DL) is a subset of ML based on multi-layer neural networks that learn complex patterns. Techniques include CNN, RNN. Applications include image recognition, speech processing.\n",

        "Question 2: Explain overfitting and underfitting in ML. How can you detect and prevent them?\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        "Overfitting occurs when a model learns noise and performs well on training data but poorly on test data. Underfitting occurs when a model is too simple and fails to learn useful patterns.\n",
        "\n",
        "Detection: Compare training and test accuracy, cross-validation, learning curves.\n",
        "\n",
        "Prevention:\n",

        "Question 4: What is an imbalanced dataset? Describe two techniques to handle it (theoretical + practical).\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        "An imbalanced dataset occurs when one class has far more samples than others (e.g., 95% normal, 5% fraud).\n",
        "\n",
        "Techniques:\n",
        "1. SMOTE (Oversampling):\n",
        "Creates synthetic minority samples to balance data.\n",

        "Question 5: Why is feature scaling important in ML? Compare Min-Max scaling and Standardization.\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        "Feature scaling is important because many algorithms use distance or gradient-based learning, and unscaled features can dominate learning.\n",
        "\n",
        "Min-Max Scaling:\n",
        "Transforms features to range 0–1. Sensitive to outliers. Useful in neural networks.\n",
        "\n",
        "Standardization:\n",
        "Transforms features to mean 0 and standard deviation 1. Less affected by outliers. Useful for SVM, KNN, logistic regression.\n",

        "Question 6: Compare Label Encoding and One-Hot Encoding. When would you prefer one over the other?\n",
        "Answer:\n",
        "Label Encoding maps categories to numeric values. Suitable for ordinal data (e.g., low, medium, high).\n",
        "\n",
        "One-Hot Encoding creates binary columns for each category. Suitable for nominal data (e.g., city, color).\n",
        "\n",
        "Prefer Label Encoding for ordered categories.\n",
